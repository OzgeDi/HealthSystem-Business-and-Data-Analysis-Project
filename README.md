# 🩺 Health Information System Project

## 🎯 Project Purpose

The purpose of this project is to present a **comprehensive end-to-end example** of processes used in health informatics systems — including **workflow diagrams (BPMN)**, **database structure (ER diagram and SQL)**, **test scenarios**, **user interface design (mockups)**, and **user acceptance tests (UAT)**.  

The goal is to create a **reference framework** for future healthcare software projects that will be developed or improved.  
All data used in this project are **randomly generated** by ChatGPT and do not contain any real or sensitive information.
